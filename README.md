##                     AplineSurfing
 
##                 WHy does this exist?

For those of use that have servers, and want to develop in a container. 
 
For an AI dev platform on the cloud.

## This is obviously a wealthy man's adventure on this one. Windsurf could probably be altered and built to work with a less costly AI Model API. 
## I did a lot of work with this at the Premium level. 
## It's doable, and it accelerates a lot, but it gets stuck in iterative processing, 
## which means it can't troubleshoot anything. 

I do love the fact, that the IDE itself is written in Go.
